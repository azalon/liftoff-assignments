## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is a Craigslist App for sharing and giving away food. Users will be able to make posts for food that they have available (cooked or raw) and others will be able to see their posts and request to pick up the items. Once an item has been taken, the taker or the giver can mark the item unavailable and the post will be deleted. Givers will be able to upload pictures of the item/s and put a location and contact number or email so takers can communicate pick-ups. Non-users will be able to view and pick up items, but will not be able to post. Users will be able to search for specific items or by location.
